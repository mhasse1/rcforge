Description: Modular shell configuration framework for Bash and other POSIX shells.
 rcForge's core functionality is written in Bash and requires Bash >=4.0
 for full functionality. The entire system is written using shell
 scripts and standard *NIX commands, so should run on most systems.
 It provides a robust and flexible framework for managing shell
 configurations and is equipped with an extensive set of support
 scripts and functions. It allows users to define their shell
 environment using modular scripts organized by purpose and loading
 order, ensuring a consistent and reproducible shell experience across
 different machines.
 .
 rcForge supports features such as machine-specific configurations,
 enabling users to tailor their shell environment to individual
 systems. It also includes a modular inclusion system for code reuse,
 conflict detection to prevent configuration clashes, and export
 functionality for easy deployment to remote servers or to systems
 that do not have rcForge installed.
 .
 This package provides the core utilities and scripts for rcForge.
 .
 Key features:
  * Cross-shell compatibility
  * Machine-specific configurations
  * Deterministic loading order
  * Conflict detection
  * Include system for modular functions
 .
 Currently in version 0.2.0 (pre-release)

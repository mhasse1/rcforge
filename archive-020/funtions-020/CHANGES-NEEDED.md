# Convert to rc-function:
domain-check.sh - This provides useful domain availability checking functionality that would work well as an rc utility. The DomainCheck function is comprehensive and would be valuable to include.
website-functions.sh - Functions like IsWebsiteUp, GetHttpStatus, and DnsLookup would be excellent rc utilities. These could complement the existing httpheaders.sh utility.
path-management.sh - The path manipulation functions would be valuable as rc utilities, especially for users who frequently modify their PATH.

# improve utility-functions
os-detection.sh - is there functionality here that needs to be added to the utility-functions? Also are these functions exported?

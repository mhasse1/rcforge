# rcForge Documentation Summaries

This document contains summaries of key documentation files for the rcForge project.

## Summary of `development-docs/rcforge-developer-guide.md` (Developer's Guide)

This document provides guidance for developers looking to create custom configurations or extend the rcForge system. It covers the system's architecture, key components, and APIs.

* **System Architecture:** rcForge uses a modular design, where functionality is divided into distinct components. Configuration files are loaded in a specific order based on their naming conventions. The core loader (`rcforge.sh`) handles the loading and processing of these files.
* **Configuration Files:** Configuration files are shell scripts that define environment variables, aliases, functions, and other shell settings. They are named according to a specific pattern to control their loading order and scope (global, hostname-specific, etc.).
* **Include System:** The include system allows developers to modularize their code by defining functions in separate files and including them in configuration scripts. This promotes code reuse and organization. (Note: As previously mentioned, this system is slated for a major overhaul in version 0.3.0).
* **APIs and Functions:** rcForge provides a set of internal functions and APIs that developers can use in their configuration files. These functions provide access to system information, perform common tasks, and interact with the rcForge framework.
* **Extensibility:** rcForge is designed to be extensible. Developers can create custom configuration files and functions to tailor the system to their specific needs. The system's modular design makes it easy to add new functionality without modifying the core code.
* **Best Practices:** The guide outlines best practices for developing rcForge configurations, including code organization, naming conventions, and security considerations. It emphasizes the importance of writing clean, maintainable, and secure code.

## Summary of `security-guide.md` (Security Guide)

This document outlines the security model and best practices for rcForge, emphasizing the importance of protecting sensitive information and maintaining system integrity.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** rcForge is designed to be used by regular users and should never be run as root. This minimizes the potential damage from misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
* **File Permissions:** rcForge enforces strict file permissions to protect configuration files from unauthorized access. Configuration files and directories should be owned by the user and have restricted permissions.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** The guide recommends secure coding practices, such as validating user input, avoiding the use of insecure functions, and properly handling sensitive data. It warns against storing sensitive information (like passwords or API keys) directly in configuration files.
* **Vulnerability Mitigation:** The guide discusses common security vulnerabilities that can arise in shell scripting and provides recommendations for mitigating them. This includes preventing command injection, avoiding the use of `eval`, and being cautious when using external data.
* **Regular Audits:** The guide emphasizes the importance of regularly auditing configuration files to identify and address potential security issues. It recommends reviewing code for vulnerabilities and ensuring that file permissions are correctly set.
* **Root User Considerations:** The guide provides specific advice for system administrators regarding the root user's environment. It recommends keeping the root user's configuration as minimal as possible and avoiding the use of rcForge for the root user.

## Summary of `universal-shell-guide.md` (Universal Shell Guide)

This document provides a comprehensive guide for users on how to set up and use the rcForge system to manage their shell environment.

* **Installation and Setup:** The guide covers the installation process for rcForge, including prerequisites, installation methods (e.g., using an installer script, manual installation), and initial configuration.
* **Configuration File Structure:** It explains the structure of rcForge configuration files, including naming conventions, file locations, and the purpose of different types of configuration files (e.g., global, hostname-specific).
* **Loading Order and Priorities:** The guide details how rcForge determines the order in which configuration files are loaded, emphasizing the use of numerical prefixes in filenames to control the loading sequence.
* **Using the Include System:** It provides instructions on how to use the include system to modularize and reuse shell functions across different configuration files. (Note: As previously mentioned, this system is slated for a major overhaul in version 0.3.0).
* **Utilities and Tools:** The guide describes the various utility scripts and tools provided by rcForge, such as scripts for checking configuration file sequences, generating configuration diagrams, and exporting configurations for remote servers.
* **Customization and Extension:** It explains how users can customize their shell environment using rcForge, including creating custom configuration files, defining aliases and functions, and managing environment variables.
* **Troubleshooting and Best Practices:** The guide provides tips for troubleshooting common issues and recommends best practices for managing shell configurations with rcForge, such as using version control and backing up configuration files.

## Summary of `getting-started.md` (Getting Started)

This document provides a quick start guide to installing and setting up rcForge.

* **Installation:** The guide outlines the basic steps for installing rcForge, including cloning the repository and running the installation script.
* **Initial Configuration:** It provides basic instructions on how to create initial configuration files and set up the rcForge environment.
* **Basic Usage:** The guide briefly explains how to use rcForge to manage shell settings and provides pointers to more detailed documentation.

## Summary of Include System (from `README.md`)

"The include system in rcForge 0.2.x is used for modular function organization with dependency management. However, it has become unwieldy due to excessive conversion of utility scripts into functions. The include system will be significantly reworked in version 0.3.x, potentially moving towards a utilities folder (`{system_root}/rcbin/`) or a core `rc` command for executing utility scripts (e.g., `rc dirsz {path}`). The future implementation may involve a blend of both approaches."
